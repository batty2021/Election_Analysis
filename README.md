# Election-Audit Summary: 
 - Modifying the script to achieve turnout results by county is just one of the minor accommodating to the code that can disclose critical data. For example; By using an if-statement we can dive deeper to determine what percentage of each county voted for each candidate and also if this were a federal election, we can use the same script and change the county to state.
